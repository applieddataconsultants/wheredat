A simple, easy to use, geocoding interface for web applications

![WhereDAT](https://raw.github.com/applieddataconsultants/wheredat/master/wheredat.png)

### What is it?

wheredat provides a geocoding and reverse geocoding interface (UI) through
[Bing](http://www.microsoft.com/maps/developers/web.aspx), [MapQuest](https://developer.mapquest.com/) or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) maps.  You setup an
instance of the application and then embed it in an iframe on any other
applications that use it.  The client app passes an address or lonlat it needs
geocoded and wheredat builds a map showing the location found allowing the user
to move the point on the map to further refine the location.  All this
information is passed back to the client app so it can be used or stored there.

Another one of its goals is to be extremely light weight and quick to load.

### Setup

Built to be served with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) although you can serve the files up statically as well.

For node do:

```sh
sudo npm install -g wheredat
wheredat [port]
```

### Message Data

wheredat uses [window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage)
for cross domain communication.  However, this is not supported in IE &lt;= 7.
If your application support legacy browsers, wheredat also calls a
function named `wheredat_geocode` on the parent window.  However for this to
work you will need to proxy your wheredat server.

The data returned will look like:

```js
{
   address: "58TH Ave, Chippewa Falls, WI 54729",
   bounds: [ 44.922998091755495, -91.2955657722567, 44.93072352689685, -91.281018090048 ],
   lat: 44.92686080932617,
   lon: -91.28829193115234,
   _mapquestObj: /* Original MapQuest Geocode Object (If using MapQuest) */
   _bingObj: /* Original Bing Geocode Object (If using Bing) */
   _mapboxObj: /* Original Mapbox Geocode OBject (If using Mapbox) */
}
```

Or if unable to geocode:

```js
{
   error: 'wheredat was unable to geocode'
}
```

This data will return whenever a geocode or reverse geocode happens (e.g.
whenever the point is moved or when the map is initially loaded).

### Example

See [the demo page](http://wheredat.adc4gis.com/mapquest-example.html) for an example of the MapQuest usage in a client side application.

See [the demo page](http://wheredat.adc4gis.com/mapbox-example.html) for an example of the Mapbox usage in a client side application.
